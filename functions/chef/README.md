CHEF has:
- meal_recipes
- crop_recipes

Based on the 'favorite' meals and crops from a user, Chef can come up with a restaurant-like menu.
It provides a the recipes with a shoppinglist per week and when to seed which crop in order for it to be harvested in time for the planned meal.

You can also just ask Chef to come up with a crop_recipe for the farmbox you have (either farmbot or hydrobox)
